By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.\n\tThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don't need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\n\tAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n\nObject Creation: You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.\n\nInstant Health: You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the Greater Restoration spell.\n\nResistance: You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent.\n\nSpell Immunity: You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.\n\nSudden Learning: You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can't replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.\n\nRoll Redo: You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a Wish spell could undo an ally's failed saving throw or a foe's Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\n\nReshape Reality: You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god's divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails.\n\tThe stress of casting Wish to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 chance that you are unable to cast Wish ever again if you suffer this stress.","source":"System Reference Document v5.2.1","roll":{"base":"2d4"},"rollList":[{"type":"base","formula":"2d4"}],"tags":["Sorcerer","Wizard"],"verbalComponent":true,"imageZoom":1.0},{"id":"word_of_recall_2024","title":"Word of Recall","level":6,"school":"Conjuration","castingTime":"Action","range":"5 feet","duration":"Instantaneous","description":"You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary.

The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the Warlock spell list later in the class's description.\n\nCantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.\n\tWhen you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.\n\nSpell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1- 5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.\n\tFor example, when you're a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Witch Bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.\n\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. Charm Person and Hex are recommended.\n\tThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1- 3.\n\tIf another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.\n\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.\n\nSpellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.\n\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.\n\nWarlock Spells Prepared:\nLevel | Prepared Spells\n1 | 2\n2 | 3\n3 | 4\n4 | 5\n5 | 6\n6 | 7\n7 | 8\n8 | 9\n9 | 10\n11 | 11\n13 | 12\n15 | 13\n17 | 14\n19 | 15\n\nSource:\tSystem Reference Document v5.2.1","type":"Warlock Class Feature","prerequisiteList":[],"spellSlotsPerLevel":{"1":[1],"2":[2],"3":[0,2],"4":[0,2],"5":[0,0,2],"6":[0,0,2],"7":[0,0,0,2],"8":[0,0,0,2],"9":[0,0,0,0,2],"10":[0,0,0,0,2],"11":[0,0,0,0,3],"12":[0,0,0,0,3],"13":[0,0,0,0,3],"14":[0,0,0,0,3],"15":[0,0,0,0,3],"16":[0,0,0,0,3],"17":[0,0,0,0,4],"18":[0,0,0,0,4],"19":[0,0,0,0,4],"20":[0,0,0,0,4]},"preparedSpells":{"1":"2","2":"3","3":"4","4":"5","5":"6","6":"7","7":"8","8":"9","9":"10","11":"11","13":"12","15":"13","17":"14","19":"15"},"cantrips":{"1":"2","2":"2","3":"2","4":"3","5":"3","6":"3","7":"3","8":"3","9":"3","10":"4","11":"4","12":"4","13":"4","14":"4","15":"4","16":"4","17":"4","18":"4","19":"4","20":"4"},"hasPactMagic":true,"actionType":""},{"id":"2_Level 2: Magical Cunning_Warlock","name":"Level 2: Magical Cunning","description":"You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute.

Some Sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their personal or family history.

So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning magic that can be passed down through generations.\r\n\r\nSorcerers don't learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect its source.\r\n\r\nSorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke.

Life is harsh and uncertain in the arctic expanses, glacial heights, and frozen seas where these dragons dwell. White dragons fiercely protect their territories, scouring the frigid regions for food and evidence of trespassers. Most white dragons ignore the plots of smaller creatures and other dragons, concerning themselves only with their own survival.\n\tWhite dragons create lairs to defend themselves from other deadly arctic creatures and from dangerous natural conditions. Within these shelters, white dragons hoard testaments to their superiority, such as monstrous skulls, the gear of defeated rivals, and curiosities that capture their interest. To protect such treasure, white dragons coax ice to form over their hoards or sink their wealth in frigid pools. For white dragons, each piece of treasure embodies a victory—the details of which inflate as these dragons age.\n\nAncient White Dragon:\nLike arctic storms, ancient white dragons threaten icy realms. They emerge from their frozen lairs to indulge their hungers for food or treasure, menacing other creatures with lethal cold. While they might ignore animals or small groups of polar wanderers, these dragons are quick to challenge other dragons and creatures wielding powerful magic, hoping to add their foes' skulls and magic items to their own hoards.\n\nSource:\tSystem Reference Document v5.2.1\n\nEnvironment: arctic","alignment":"chaotic evil","senses":"blindsight 60 ft., darkvision 120 ft.","customProeficiencyBonus":"+6","languages":["Common","Draconic"],"skillProficiencies":{"Acrobatics":false,"Animal Handling":false,"Arcana":false,"Athletics":false,"Deception":false,"History":false,"Insight":false,"Intimidation":false,"Investigation":false,"Medicine":false,"Nature":false,"Perception":true,"Performance":false,"Persuasion":false,"Religion":false,"Sleight of Hand":false,"Stealth":true,"Survival":false,"Wisdom":true,"Dexterity":true},"skillModifiers":{"Acrobatics":0,"Animal Handling":0,"Arcana":0,"Athletics":0,"Deception":0,"History":0,"Insight":0,"Intimidation":0,"Investigation":0,"Medicine":0,"Nature":0,"Perception":6,"Performance":0,"Persuasion":0,"Religion":0,"Sleight of Hand":0,"Stealth":0,"Survival":0},"isNPC":true,"type":"dragon (chromatic)","cr":20.0,"immunities":["Cold"],"uses2014RuleSet":false},{"id":"animated_armor_[2024]_monster","name":"Animated Armor","species":{"id":"construct","name":"construct","description":"","size":"Medium","speed":"25 ft.","traits":[],"abilityScores":[],"proficiency":[],"skillProficiencies":[],"numberOfSkills":0,"spellAbility":"","source":null,"variantSpecies":[],"features":[]},"class":[{"id":"monster","name":"construct","source":"","hitPointDie":"6d8+6","hitPointsAtLevel1":"","hitPointsPerLevel":"","numberOfSkills":0,"classFeatures":{"0":[{"id":null,"name":"Animated Armor","type":"construct","prerequisiteList":[]}]},"subClasses":{"0":[{"subClassId":"52ae3c1f-fca7-4e9c-bf1b-591b8bd36620","name":"","source":""}]}}],"attributes":{"Strength":14,"Dexterity":11,"Constitution":13,"Intelligence":1,"Wisdom":3,"Charisma":1},"image":"assets/images/token.png","background":{"id":"monster_background","name":"Monster","source":"System Reference Document v5.2.1","description":"","abilityScores":[],"features":[],"skillProficiencies":[],"toolProficiency":"","equipment":[]},"maxHP":33,"currentHP":33,"armorClass":18,"speed":"25 ft.","initiative":2,"equipment":[{"id":"animated_armor_2024_multiattack","title":"Multiattack","description":"The armor makes two Slam attacks.","quantity":1,"weight":0.0,"type":"Others","properties":"Action","equipped":true,"attributesToAc":{"Strength":false,"Dexterity":true,"Constitution":false,"Intelligence":false,"Wisdom":false,"Charisma":false},"damageAttribute":"Strength","hitBonusAttribute":"Strength","useAttributeModifier":false,"useHitBonusModifier":false,"range":"","reach":""},{"id":"animated_armor_2024_slam","title":"Slam","description":"Melee Attack Roll: +4, reach 5 ft.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a location that no longer exists.\n\nMishap: The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 Force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).\n\nSimilar Area: You and your group (or the target object) appear in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. You appear in the closest similar place. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might appear in another person's laboratory in the same city.\n\nOff Target: You and your group (or the target object) appear 2d12 miles away from the destination in a random direction.

They dwell in deserts and badlands, particularly regions with dramatic spires from whose tops they might see for miles. They seek lairs near sites of symbolic power, such as the abandoned fortresses of giants, the colossi of fallen empires, or monuments raised by their followers.\n\tRegalia of rulership and artistic masterpieces fill blue dragons' hoards. These dragons have no interest in treasures that are common or flawed, preferring one-of-a-kind gemstones, the crowns of fallen royals, and magic items capable of spreading the dragons' influence.\n\nBlue dragon wyrmlings often serve other powerful creatures, learning the ways of control and establishing fearful reputations among weaker creatures. Many wyrmlings initially serve loyally, but as their powers grow to match their ambitions, they eventually betray or abandon their associates.

They enjoy adopting Humanoid forms, disguising themselves as traveling merchants, scholars, storytellers, or anyone else invested in others' stories.\n\tBrass dragons collect eclectic objects.

When unsuspecting prey nears, cloakers unfurl and attempt to latch on and then smother their victims in their powerful wings.\n\tCloakers delight in frightening foes. In addition to their methods of ambush, cloakers can create illusory duplicates of themselves and emit surreal moans that non-cloakers find terrifying in unexplainable, primal ways.

As a Magic action on your later turns, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\n\nFlood: You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 chance of capsizing.\n\tThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\n\nPart Water: You part water in the area and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n\nRedirect Flow: You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\n\nWhirlpool: You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area, which must be at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool lasts until you choose a different effect or the spell ends. The whirlpool is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature in the water and within 25 feet of the whirlpool is pulled 10 feet toward it. When a creature enters the whirlpool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 Bludgeoning damage.

Some privately pursue esoteric secrets, while others form shadowy cabals seeking to bring about terrifying ends.

Any cult might have the following sorts of members.\n\nCultist Fanatic:\nCultist fanatics lead small cults or cells within larger cults.

In addition to goring foes with their deadly horns and trampling them under their iron hooves, gorgons exhale gouts of noxious gas.\n\tGorgons are created by magic-users to serve as guardians. The process for creating a gorgon is labor intensive and dangerous, with one method requiring the skeleton of a bull, the blood of a medusa, and the brain of a basilisk fused into a frame of ensorcelled iron. If the process fails, petrifying gas emerges from the materials, creating a magical threat that can fill a structure and linger for years.\n\tWhen magic-users create gorgons, they often enchant them to ignore those who confront the creature with a specific command key, usually a password or a specific signal. Once a gorgon is set to guard an area, it attacks any who enter until they flee or are destroyed. Should someone provide the command key, the monster ignores that intruder so long as the intruder remains in its sight. But if the intruder ventures out of sight and then returns without again presenting the command key, the gorgon attacks. Those in a gorgon's territory must remain vigilant and aware of the monster's exact position, or they risk being attacked by a gorgon they thought was no longer a threat.\n\tThose who create gorgons strive to give them purposefully obscure command keys. Hints at command keys might be found among the records of a gorgon's creator or in the area the gorgon protects—perhaps scrawled as a petrified trespasser's final act. Roll on or choose a result from the Gorgon Command Keys table to inspire the word or signal that temporarily neutralizes a gorgon.\n\nGorgon Command Keys:\n1d6 | Gorgon Won't Attack Those That...\n1 | Cast a particular spell in the gorgon's presence.\n2 | Keep their back to the gorgon or otherwise act like they don't see the monster.\n3 | Offer it a drink of blood, water, or wine.\n4 | Recite a specific rhyme or sing a certain song.\n5 | Say its creator's name backward.\n6 | Wear a mask, perhaps in the shape of a bull or an animal meaningful to the gorgon's creator.\n\nMost gorgons are iron bulls wreathed in clouds of petrifying gas. Their metal plates vary in sheen and color, from sleek silver to pitted black. The oldest gorgons might be covered in rust, but this rarely impedes their abilities. These gorgons' stomping grounds are littered with the shattered remains of petrified foes. Many gorgons outlive their creators by centuries, misleading some to believe these creations have natural origins and territories.

Lone hobgoblins claim woodland territories and plunder the wilds. In groups, they form hierarchical, martial societies bent on conquering lands and stripping them of resources to serve their expansionist zeal.\n\tHobgoblins often subjugate animals, monsters, and destructive Fey—particularly goblins and bugbears—to serve their plans. Hobgoblins might ally with dragons, warlords, the servants of warlike gods, or other powerful creatures that promise them control of new territories. Should hobgoblins bring an entire land to heel, they seek new conquests, venturing across seas, into the Underdark, or to stars and planes of existence beyond.\n\tMany hobgoblins serve the violent god Maglubiyet, whose hunger for conquest matches their own. Hobgoblin followers of Maglubiyet flourish in the Infinite Battlefield of Acheron, where they endlessly indulge their drive for domination. These war-obsessed hobgoblins employ elaborate tactics and strange weapons, which they sometimes unleash on worlds of the Material Plane.\n\nHobgoblin Warfare:\nThe drive to subjugate and pillage is part of hobgoblins' supernatural nature, though a few might repress their warlike tendencies or turn them to more useful ends.

Lone hobgoblins claim woodland territories and plunder the wilds. In groups, they form hierarchical, martial societies bent on conquering lands and stripping them of resources to serve their expansionist zeal.\n\tHobgoblins often subjugate animals, monsters, and destructive Fey—particularly goblins and bugbears—to serve their plans. Hobgoblins might ally with dragons, warlords, the servants of warlike gods, or other powerful creatures that promise them control of new territories. Should hobgoblins bring an entire land to heel, they seek new conquests, venturing across seas, into the Underdark, or to stars and planes of existence beyond.\n\tMany hobgoblins serve the violent god Maglubiyet, whose hunger for conquest matches their own. Hobgoblin followers of Maglubiyet flourish in the Infinite Battlefield of Acheron, where they endlessly indulge their drive for domination. These war-obsessed hobgoblins employ elaborate tactics and strange weapons, which they sometimes unleash on worlds of the Material Plane.\n\nHobgoblin Warfare:\nThe drive to subjugate and pillage is part of hobgoblins' supernatural nature, though a few might repress their warlike tendencies or turn them to more useful ends.

They employ simple tactics and exploit every advantage their allies provide.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.\n\tThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don't need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\n\tAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n\nObject Creation: You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.\n\nInstant Health: You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the Greater Restoration spell.\n\nResistance: You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent.\n\nSpell Immunity: You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.\n\nSudden Learning: You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can't replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.\n\nRoll Redo: You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a Wish spell could undo an ally's failed saving throw or a foe's Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\n\nReshape Reality: You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god's divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails.\n\tThe stress of casting Wish to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 chance that you are unable to cast Wish ever again if you suffer this stress.","source":"System Reference Document v5.2.1","roll":{"base":"2d4"},"rollList":[{"type":"base","formula":"2d4"}],"tags":["Sorcerer","Wizard"],"verbalComponent":true,"imageZoom":1.0},{"id":"detect_magic_2024","title":"Detect Magic","level":1,"school":"Divination","castingTime":"Action","range":"30 feet","duration":"Concentration, up to 10 minute","description":"For the duration, you sense the presence of magical effects within 30 feet of yourself.

Occasionally, these grotesque swarms arise from mass graves or after tragedies, refusing to let their murderers escape their grasp.\n\nSource:\tSystem Reference Document v5.2.1\n\nEnvironment: any","alignment":"neutral evil","senses":"blindsight 30 ft.","customProeficiencyBonus":"+2","languages":["understands Common but can't speak"],"isNPC":true,"type":"undead","cr":3.0,"resistances":["Bludgeoning","Piercing","Slashing"],"immunities":["Necrotic","Poison"],"uses2014RuleSet":false},{"id":"swarm_of_insects_[2024]_monster","name":"Swarm of Insects","species":{"id":"beast","name":"beast","description":"","size":"Medium","speed":"20 ft., choose null ft.null","traits":[],"abilityScores":[],"proficiency":[],"skillProficiencies":[],"numberOfSkills":0,"spellAbility":"","source":null,"variantSpecies":[],"features":[]},"class":[{"id":"monster","name":"beast","source":"","hitPointDie":"3d8+6","hitPointsAtLevel1":"","hitPointsPerLevel":"","numberOfSkills":0,"classFeatures":{"0":[{"id":null,"name":"Swarm of Insects","type":"beast","prerequisiteList":[]}]},"subClasses":{"0":[{"subClassId":"43c5caf4-479f-4df9-bc2f-71d4de6acab3","name":"","source":""}]}}],"attributes":{"Strength":3,"Dexterity":13,"Constitution":14,"Intelligence":1,"Wisdom":7,"Charisma":1},"image":"assets/images/token.png","background":{"id":"monster_background","name":"Monster","source":"System Reference Document v5.2.1","description":"","abilityScores":[],"features":[],"skillProficiencies":[],"toolProficiency":"","equipment":[]},"maxHP":19,"currentHP":19,"armorClass":11,"speed":"20 ft., choose null ft.null","initiative":1,"equipment":[{"id":"swarm_of_insects_2024_bites","title":"Bites","description":"Melee Attack Roll: +3, reach 5 ft.

A terror of massive size and overwhelming might, this primeval destroyer survives from the earliest epochs of the Material Plane, when it served as a weapon of immortal forces. Since then, the tarrasque has slumbered in secret, rising every few ages to usher in eras of destruction.\n\tThe tarrasque is a bipedal, prehistoric Monstrosity that stands over seventy feet tall. Bristling with horns and spikes, its spiny carapace deflects harm and can reflect magical attacks.\n\tThe tarrasque is a creature of tireless rage. It lashes out at any creature that catches its attention, thrashing with claws and its mighty tail while swallowing smaller beings whole. It seems to take instinctual offense at the works of lesser beings, venting its rage at buildings, bridges, ships, and monuments. The larger a structure or foe is, the greater the tarrasque's wrath.\n\tIt is a mystery what—if anything—calms the tarrasque, but eventually it returns to its slumber, leaving the world irrevocably changed. While the tarrasque might be halted by incredible opposition, its threat can never be wiped from the multiverse. Whenever the tarrasque is defeated, another tarrasque awakes somewhere else on the Material Plane.\n\tFew things survive the tarrasque's rampages, and reports of the monster's devastation are often contradictory, incomplete, or beyond belief. In cases where it leaves no survivors, its calamities might initially be blamed on evil dragons or magical disasters, but the tarrasque frequently leaves behind some unmistakable indication of its passage.

To protect such treasure, white dragons coax ice to form over their hoards or sink their wealth in frigid pools. For white dragons, each piece of treasure embodies a victory—the details of which inflate as these dragons age.\n\nWhite Dragon Wyrmling:\nWhite dragon wyrmlings usually head off on their own soon after hatching. While the cold means little to these creatures, food is scarce in arctic realms, and predators there are merciless. Most white dragon wyrmlings survive by scavenging, hunting opportunistically, and quickly fleeing foes—including other white dragons.\n\nSource:\tSystem Reference Document v5.2.1\n\nEnvironment: arctic","alignment":"chaotic evil","senses":"blindsight 10 ft., darkvision 60 ft.","customProeficiencyBonus":"+2","languages":["Draconic"],"skillProficiencies":{"Acrobatics":false,"Animal Handling":false,"Arcana":false,"Athletics":false,"Deception":false,"History":false,"Insight":false,"Intimidation":false,"Investigation":false,"Medicine":false,"Nature":false,"Perception":true,"Performance":false,"Persuasion":false,"Religion":false,"Sleight of Hand":false,"Stealth":true,"Survival":false,"Wisdom":true,"Dexterity":true},"skillModifiers":{"Acrobatics":0,"Animal Handling":0,"Arcana":0,"Athletics":0,"Deception":0,"History":0,"Insight":0,"Intimidation":0,"Investigation":0,"Medicine":0,"Nature":0,"Perception":2,"Performance":0,"Persuasion":0,"Religion":0,"Sleight of Hand":0,"Stealth":0,"Survival":0},"isNPC":true,"type":"dragon (chromatic)","cr":2.0,"immunities":["Cold"],"uses2014RuleSet":false},{"id":"wight_[2024]_monster","name":"Wight","species":{"id":"undead","name":"undead","description":"","size":"Medium","speed":"30 ft.","traits":[],"abilityScores":[],"proficiency":[],"skillProficiencies":[],"numberOfSkills":0,"spellAbility":"","source":null,"variantSpecies":[],"features":[]},"class":[{"id":"monster","name":"undead","source":"","hitPointDie":"11d8+33","hitPointsAtLevel1":"","hitPointsPerLevel":"","numberOfSkills":0,"classFeatures":{"0":[{"id":null,"name":"Wight","type":"undead","prerequisiteList":[]}]},"subClasses":{"0":[{"subClassId":"18eaae4c-c4db-41b1-9cf1-99869e7165fb","name":"","source":""}]}}],"attributes":{"Strength":15,"Dexterity":14,"Constitution":16,"Intelligence":10,"Wisdom":13,"Charisma":15},"image":"assets/images/token.png","background":{"id":"monster_background","name":"Monster","source":"System Reference Document v5.2.1","description":"","abilityScores":[],"features":[],"skillProficiencies":[],"toolProficiency":"","equipment":[]},"maxHP":82,"currentHP":82,"armorClass":14,"speed":"30 ft.","initiative":4,"equipment":[{"id":"wight_2024_multiattack","title":"Multiattack","description":"The wight makes two attacks, using Necrotic Sword or Necrotic Bow in any combination.
