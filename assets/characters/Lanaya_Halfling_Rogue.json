That said, many halflings possess a brave and adventurous spirit that leads them on journeys of discovery, affording them the chance to explore a bigger world and make new friends along the way. Their size -similar to that of a human child- helps them pass through crowds unnoticed and slip through tight spaces.\n\tAnyone who has spent time around halflings, particularly halfling adventurers, has likely witnessed the storied \"luck of the halflings\" in action. When a halfling is in mortal danger, an unseen force seems to intervene on the halfling's behalf. Many halflings believe in the power of luck, and they attribute their unusual gift to one or more of their benevolent gods, including Yondalla, Brandobaris, and Charmalaine. The same gift might contribute to their robust life spans (about 150 years).\n\tHalfling communities come in all varieties. For every sequestered shire tucked away in an unspoiled part of the world, there's a crime syndicate like the Boromar Clan in the Eberron setting or a territorial mob of halflings like those in the Dark Sun setting.\n\tHalflings who prefer to live underground are sometimes called strongheart halflings or stouts. Nomadic halflings, as well as those who live among humans and other tall folk. are sometimes called lightfoot halflings or tallfellows.\n\nSource:\tSystem Reference Document v5.2","size":"Small","speed":"30 ft.","traits":[{"name":"Creature Type","description":"Humanoid"},{"name":"Size","description":"Small (about 2-3 feet tall)"},{"name":"Brave","description":"You have Advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the Frightened condition."},{"name":"Halfling Nimbleness","description":"You can move through the space of any creature that is a size larger than you. but you can't stop in the same space."},{"name":"Luck","description":"When you roll a 1 on the d20 of a D20 Test. you can reroll the die, and you must use the new roll."},{"name":"Naturally Stealthy","description":"You can take the Hide action even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you."}],"abilityScores":[],"proficiency":[],"skillProficiencies":[],"numberOfSkills":0,"spellAbility":"","source":"System Reference Document v5.2","variantSpecies":[],"features":[{"id":"feature_Halfling: Brave (Frightened)_1765824759130","name":"Halfling: Brave (Frightened)","description":"You have Advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the Frightened condition.","type":"Species Feature","prerequisiteList":[],"proficiencyBonus":"","bonusAc":"","bonusSavingThrow":"","bonusWeaponHit":"","bonusWeaponDamage":"","bonusSpellAttack":"","bonusSpellDC":"","bonusHitPoints":"","bonusInitiative":"","bonusSpeed":"","bonusPassiveWisdom":"","skillAdvModifier":{"Wisdom":"advantage"}}]},"class":[{"id":"rogue_[2024]","name":"Rogue","source":"Unknown","hitPointDie":"1d8","hitPointsAtLevel1":"8 + Constitution","hitPointsPerLevel":"1d8 + Constitution","numberOfSkills":4,"primaryAbility":{"logic":"SINGLE","abilities":{"Dexterity":"required"}},"savingThrowProficiencies":["Dexterity","Intelligence"],"skillProficiencies":["Acrobatics","Athletics","Deception","Insight","Intimidation","Investigation","Perception","Performance","Persuasion","Sleight of Hand","Stealth"],"weaponProficiencies":"Simple Weapons","armorTraining":"Light Armor","startingEquipmentOptions":["Leather Armor, 2 Daggers, Shortsword, Shortbow, 20 Arrows, Quiver, Thieves' Tools, Burglar's Pack, and 8 GP","100 GP"],"multiclassNumberOfSkills":1,"multiclassWeaponProficiencies":"Simple Weapons","multiclassArmorTraining":"Light Armor","spellcastingMultiplier":0.33,"spellAbility":"Intelligence","classFeatures":{"1":[{"id":"Becoming A Rogue As A Level 1 Character_Rogue","name":"Becoming A Rogue As A Level 1 Character","description":"As a 1st-level Rogue, you begin play with 8 + your Constitution modifier hit points.\n\nCore Rogue Traits\nPrimary Ability: Dexterity\nHit Point Die: D8 per Rogue level\nSaving Throw Proficiencies: Dexterity and Intelligence\nSkill Proficiencies: Choose 4: Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth\nWeapon Proficiencies: Simple weapons and Martial weapons that have the Finesse or Light property\nTool Proficiencies: Thieves' Tools\nArmor Training: Light armor\nStarting Equipment: Choose A or 8: (A) Leather Armor, 2 Daggers, Shortsword, Shortbow, 20 Arrows, Quiver, Thieves' Tools, Burglar's Pack, and 8 GP; or (B) 100 GP\n\nSource:\tSystem Reference Document v5.2","type":"Rogue Class Feature","prerequisiteList":[]},{"id":"Becoming A Rogue As A Multiclass Character_Rogue","name":"Becoming A Rogue As A Multiclass Character","description":"Core Rogue Traits\nPrimary Ability: Dexterity\nHit Point Die: D8 per Rogue level\nSkill Proficiencies: Choose 1: Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth\nTool Proficiencies: Thieves' Tools\nArmor Training: Light armor\n\nSource:\tSystem Reference Document v5.2","type":"Rogue Class Feature","prerequisiteList":[]},{"id":"Level 1: Expertise_Rogue","name":"Level 1: Expertise","description":"You gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

Orphaned young, she grew up among the maze of alleys and bridges that connect the city’s underbelly, learning fast that quick fingers and quicker wits were worth more than any coin purse.\r\n\r\nBy her teenage years, Lanaya had become a known — though rarely caught — presence in the city’s criminal circles. She started small: cutting purses in the market, lifting trinkets from inattentive travelers. But her true talent lay in information — knowing who owed what, who was cheating whom, and which guards could be bribed.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t long before she caught the attention of The Guild, Baldur’s Gate’s infamous thieves’ network. They offered her a place, and Lanaya took it — though never fully trusted them. She learned everything they had to teach: stealth, locks, poisons, persuasion. But after one too many betrayals and one near-deadly job, she walked away, vowing to never again be anyone’s pawn.\r\n\r\nNow, Lanaya works for herself — sometimes as a spy, sometimes as a smuggler, sometimes as an uninvited guest in mansions belonging to those who think themselves untouchable. Beneath her cynicism, though, she keeps a soft spot for the city’s street kids, slipping coins or stolen bread to those who remind her of herself.","alignment":"Caótico e Neutro","languages":["Common","Thieves' Cant","Common Sign Language","Deep Speech"],"weaponProficiencies":["Simple Weapons","Martial Weapons"],"armorShieldProficiencies":["Light Armor"],"skillProficiencies":{"Sleight of Hand":true,"Stealth":true,"Perception":true,"Persuasion":true,"Acrobatics":true,"Insight":true,"Dexterity":true,"Intelligence":true,"Constitution":false},"goldPieces":24,"uses2014RuleSet":false}
