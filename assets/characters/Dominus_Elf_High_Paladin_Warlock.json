They lost this ability when Corellon cursed them for plotting with the deity Lolth, who tried and failed to usurp Corellon's dominion. When Lolth was cast into the Abyss, most elves renounced her and earned Corellon's forgiveness, but that which Corellon had taken from them was lost forever.\n\tNo longer able to shapeshift at will, the elves retreated to the Feywild, where their sorrow was deepened by that plane's influence. Over time, curiosity led many of them to explore other planes of existence, including worlds in the Material Plane.\n\tElves have pointed ears and lack facial and body hair. They live for around 750 years, and they don't sleep but instead enter a trance when they need to rest. In that state, they remain aware of their surroundings while immersing themselves in memories and meditations.\n\tAn environment subtly transforms elves after they inhabit it for a millennium or more, and it grants them certain kinds of magic. Drow, high elves, and wood elves are examples of elves who have been transformed thus.\n\nHigh elves have been infused with the magic of crossings between the Feywild and the Material Plane. On some worlds. high elves refer to themselves by other names. For example. they call them· selves sun or moon elves in the Forgotten Realms setting, Silvanesti and Qualinesti in the Dragon· lance setting, and Aereni in the Eberron setting.\n\nSource:\tSystem Reference Document v5.2","size":"Medium","speed":"30 ft.","traits":[{"name":"Creature Type","description":"Humanoid"},{"name":"Size","description":"Medium (about 5-6 feet tall)"},{"name":"Darkvision","description":"You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet."},{"name":"High Elf Lineage","description":"You know the Prestidigitation cantrip.

The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the Warlock spell list later in the class's description.\n\nCantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.\n\tWhen you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.\n\nSpell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1- 5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.\n\tFor example, when you're a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Witch Bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.\n\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. Charm Person and Hex are recommended.\n\tThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1- 3.\n\tIf another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.\n\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.\n\nSpellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.\n\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.\n\nWarlock Spells Prepared:\nLevel | Prepared Spells\n1 | 2\n2 | 3\n3 | 4\n4 | 5\n5 | 6\n6 | 7\n7 | 8\n8 | 9\n9 | 10\n11 | 11\n13 | 12\n15 | 13\n17 | 14\n19 | 15\n\nSource:\tSystem Reference Document v5.2","type":"Warlock Class Feature","prerequisiteList":[],"spellSlotsPerLevel":{"1":[1],"2":[2],"3":[0,2],"4":[0,2],"5":[0,0,2],"6":[0,0,2],"7":[0,0,0,2],"8":[0,0,0,2],"9":[0,0,0,0,2],"10":[0,0,0,0,2],"11":[0,0,0,0,3],"12":[0,0,0,0,3],"13":[0,0,0,0,3],"14":[0,0,0,0,3],"15":[0,0,0,0,3],"16":[0,0,0,0,3],"17":[0,0,0,0,4],"18":[0,0,0,0,4],"19":[0,0,0,0,4],"20":[0,0,0,0,4]},"preparedSpells":{"1":"2","2":"3","3":"4","4":"5","5":"6","6":"7","7":"8","8":"9","9":"10","11":"11","13":"12","15":"13","17":"14","19":"15"},"cantrips":{"1":"2","2":"2","3":"2","4":"3","5":"3","6":"3","7":"3","8":"3","9":"3","10":"4","11":"4","12":"4","13":"4","14":"4","15":"4","16":"4","17":"4","18":"4","19":"4","20":"4"},"attributesToAc":{"Strength":false,"Dexterity":false,"Constitution":false,"Intelligence":false,"Wisdom":false,"Charisma":false},"abilityScoreImprovement":false,"skillProficiencies":{"Acrobatics":false,"Animal Handling":false,"Arcana":false,"Athletics":false,"Deception":false,"History":false,"Insight":false,"Intimidation":false,"Investigation":false,"Medicine":false,"Nature":false,"Perception":false,"Performance":false,"Persuasion":false,"Religion":false,"Sleight of Hand":false,"Stealth":false,"Survival":false},"skillExpertise":{"Acrobatics":false,"Animal Handling":false,"Arcana":false,"Athletics":false,"Deception":false,"History":false,"Insight":false,"Intimidation":false,"Investigation":false,"Medicine":false,"Nature":false,"Perception":false,"Performance":false,"Persuasion":false,"Religion":false,"Sleight of Hand":false,"Stealth":false,"Survival":false},"halfSkillProficiency":{"Acrobatics":false,"Animal Handling":false,"Arcana":false,"Athletics":false,"Deception":false,"History":false,"Insight":false,"Intimidation":false,"Investigation":false,"Medicine":false,"Nature":false,"Perception":false,"Performance":false,"Persuasion":false,"Religion":false,"Sleight of Hand":false,"Stealth":false,"Survival":false},"customResource":"0","hasPactMagic":true}],"2":[{"id":"Level 2: Magical Cunning_Warlock","name":"Level 2: Magical Cunning","description":"You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute.

You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.\n\tWhen you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.\n\nSpell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1- 5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.\n\tFor example, when you're a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Witch Bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.\n\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells.

Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1- 3.\n\tIf another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.\n\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.\n\nSpellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.\n\nSpellcasting Focus.
