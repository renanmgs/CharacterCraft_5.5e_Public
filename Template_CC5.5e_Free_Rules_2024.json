While bound, a creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls, and the creature is Restrained if the Manacles are attached to a chain or hook that is fixed in place. Escaping the Manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check as an action. Bursting them requires a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check as an action.\n\nEach set of Manacles comes with a key. Without the key, a creature can use Thieves' Tools to pick the Manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 226",

You can take the Utilize action to pour an Oil flask on level ground to cover a 5-foot-square area within 5 feet of yourself. If lit, the oil burns until the end of the turn 2 rounds from when the oil was lit (or 12 seconds) and deals 5 Fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn there. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.\n\nFuel: Oil serves as fuel for Lamps and Lanterns. Once lit, a flask of Oil burns for 6 hours in a Lamp or Lantern.

The broom stops hovering when you land or when you're no longer riding it.\n\nAs a Magic action, you can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you name the location and are familiar with it. The broom comes back to you when you take a Magic action and use a command word if the broom is still within 1 mile of you.\n\nSource:\tDungeon Master's Guide 2024 p. 241",

A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.\n\nThe magic of the deck functions only if its cards are drawn at random. You can take a Magic action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of yourself. An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. The illusory creature created by the card looks and behaves like a real creature of its kind, except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can take a Magic action to move it anywhere within 30 feet of its card.\n\nAny physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be false, because objects pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to visually inspect the illusory creature identifies it as an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a Dispel Magic spell or a similar effect). When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.\n\n1d100 | Illusion\n01-03 | Adult Red Dragon\n04-06 | Archmage\n07-09 | Assassin\n10-12 | Bandit Captain\n13-15 | Beholder\n16-18 | Berserker\n19-21 | Bugbear Warrior\n22-24 | Cloud Giant\n25-27 | Druid\n28-30 | Erinyes\n31-33 | Ettin\n34-36 | Fire Giant\n37-39 | Frost Giant\n40-42 | Gnoll Warrior\n43-45 | Goblin Warrior\n46-48 | Guardian Naga\n49-51 | Hill Giant\n52-54 | Hobgoblin Warrior\n55-57 | Incubus\n58-60 | Iron Golem\n61-63 | Knight\n64-66 | Kobold Warrior\n67-69 | Lich\n70-72 | Medusa\n73-75 | Night Hag\n76-78 | Ogre\n79-81 | Oni\n82-84 | Priest\n85-87 | Succubus\n88-90 | Troll\n91-93 | Warrior Veteran\n94-96 | Wyvern\n97-00 | The card drawer\n\nSource:\tDungeon Master's Guide 2024 p. 249",

Most (75 percent) of these decks have thirteen cards, but some have twenty-two. Use the appropriate column of the Deck of Many Things table when randomly determining cards drawn from the deck.\n\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.\n\nOnce a card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, reroll on the table if that card comes up again.)\n\n1d100 (13-Card Deck) | 1d100 (22-Card Deck) | Card\nâ | 01-05 | Balance\nâ | 06-10 | Comet\nâ | 11-14 | Donjon\n01-08 | 15-18 | Euryale\nâ | 19-23 | Fates\n09-16 | 24-27 | Flames\nâ | 28-31 | Fool\nâ | 32-36 | Gem\n17-24 | 37-41 | Jester\n25-32 | 42-46 | Key\n33-40 | 47-51 | Knight\n41-48 | 52-56 | Moon\nâ | 57-60 | Puzzle\n49-56 | 61-64 | Rogue\n57-64 | 65-68 | Ruin\nâ | 69-73 | Sage\n65-72 | 74-77 | Skull\n73-80 | 78-82 | Star\n81-88 | 83-87 | Sun\nâ | 88-91 | Talons\n89-96 | 92-96 | Throne\n97-00 | 97-00 | Void\n\nEach card's effect is described below.\n\nBalance: You can increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 22, provided you also decrease another one of your ability scores by 2. You can't decrease an ability that has a score of 5 or lower. Alternatively, you can choose not to adjust your ability scores, in which case this card has no effect.\n\nComet: The next time you enter combat against one or more Hostile creatures, you can select one of them as your foe when you roll Initiative. If you reduce your foe to 0 Hit Points during that combat, you have Advantage on Death Saving Throws for 1 year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0 Hit Points or you don't choose a foe, this card has no effect.\n\nDonjon: You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you're wearing and carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts, which stay behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any Divination magic, but a Wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\n\nEuryale: The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty to saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the Fates card can end this curse.\n\nFates: Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\n\nFlames: A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and torments you, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n\nFool: You have Disadvantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn't count as one of your declared draws.\n\nGem: Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 GP each or fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at your feet.\n\nJester: You have Advantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\nKey: A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears on your person. The DM chooses the weapon.\n\nKnight: You gain the service of a Knight, who magically appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the same alignment as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the two of you have been drawn together by fate. Work with your DM to create a name and backstory for this NPC. The DM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired.\n\nMoon: You gain the ability to cast Wish 1d3 times.\n\nPuzzle: Permanently reduce your Intelligence or Wisdom by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n\nRogue: An NPC of the DM's choice becomes Hostile toward you. You don't know the identity of this NPC until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a Wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\nRuin: All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. If you have a Bastion (see the the Dungeon Master's Guide), it is destroyed by some calamity beyond your control. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\nSage: At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question.\n\nSkull: An Avatar of Death appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the avatar, that ally summons another Avatar of Death. The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as close to that ally as possible and targets only that ally with its attacks. You and your allies can each summon only one avatar as a consequence of this draw. A creature slain by an avatar can't be restored to life.\n\nStar: Increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 24.\n\nSun: A magic item (chosen by the DM) appears on your person. In addition, you gain 10 Temporary Hit Points daily at dawn until you die.\n\nTalons: Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish instead.\n\nThrone: You gain proficiency and Expertise in your choice of History, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently home to one or more monsters, which must be cleared out before you can claim the keep as yours.\n\nVoid: Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert, ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A Wish spell can't return your soul to your body, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds your soul. You draw no more cards.\n\nSource:\tDungeon Master's Guide 2024 p. 250",

Until it disappears, the arrow emits Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet.\n\nThis weapon has the following additional properties.\n\nArrow of Restraint: Whenever you use this weapon to make a ranged attack against a creature, you can try to restrain the target instead of dealing damage to it. If the arrow hits, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the Restrained condition for 1 minute. As an action, a creature Restrained by an arrow can make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to try to break the restraint, ending the effect on itself on a successful check.\n\nArrow of Transport: As a Magic action, you can fire one energy arrow from this weapon at a target you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target can be either a willing Medium or smaller creature or an object that isn't being worn or carried, provided the object is small enough to fit inside a 5-foot Cube. The arrow teleports the target to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of you.\n\nEnergy Ladder: As a Magic action, you can loose a flurry of energy arrows from this weapon at a wall up to 60 feet away from yourself. The arrows become glowing rungs that stick out of the wall, forming a magical ladder up to 60 feet long on the wall. This ladder lasts for 1 minute before disappearing.\n\nSlow (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit more than once by weapons that have this property, the Speed reduction doesn't exceed 10 feet.\n\nAmmunition: You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon's range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.\n\nHeavy: You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it's a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn't at least 13 or if it's a Ranged weapon and  your Dexterity score isn't at least 13.\n\nTwo-Handed: A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.\n\nProficiency: martial, longbow\nSource:\tDungeon Master's Guide 2024 p. 257",

            "description": "This pointed hat has the following properties.\n\nSpellcasting Focus: While holding the hat, you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells. Any spell you cast using the hat gains a special Somatic component: you must reach into the hat and \"pull\" the spell out of it.\n\nUnknown Spell: While holding the hat, you can try to cast a level 1+ spell you don't know. The spell must be on the Wizard spell list, it must be of a level you can cast, and it can't have Material components costing more than 1,000 GP. Once you decide on the spell, you must expend a spell slot of the spell's level. Then, to determine whether you cast the spell, make an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 plus the spell's level). On a successful check, you cast the spell using its normal casting time, and you can't use this property again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. On a failed check, you fail to cast the spell and a random effect occurs instead, determined by rolling on the following table.\n\nAny spell you cast from the hat uses your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.\n\n1d100 | Effect\n01-50 | You cast a random spell determined by rolling 1d10: on a 1, Enlarge/Reduce (enlarge effect); on a 2, Enlarge/Reduce (reduce effect); on a 3, Faerie Fire; on a 4, Fireball; on a 5, Gust of Wind; on a 6, Invisibility (cast on yourself); on a 7, Lightning Bolt; on an 8, Phantasmal Force; on a 9, Polymorph; on a 10, Stinking Cloud.\n51-55 | You have the Stunned condition until the end of your next turn, believing something awesome just happened.\n56-60 | A harmless swarm of butterflies fills a 10-foot Cube within 30 feet of yourself. The swarm disperses after 1 minute.\n61-65 | You pull a nonmagical object out of the hat. Roll 1d4 to determine the object: on a 1, a vial of Acid; on a 2, a flask of Alchemist's Fire; on a 3, a Crowbar; on a 4, a lit Torch.\n66-70 | You suffer a bout of \"magic sickness\" and have the Poisoned condition for 1 hour.\n71-75 | You have the Petrified condition until the end of your next turn.\n76-80 | You pull a nonmagical object out of the hat. Roll 1d4 to determine the object: on a 1, a Dagger; on a 2, a Rope with a Grappling Hook tied to one end; on a 3, a bag of Caltrops; on a 4, a gem worth 50 GP.\n81-85 | A creature appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The creature isn't under your control and acts as it normally would, and it disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 Hit Points. Roll 1d4 to determine the creature: on a 1, a Camel; on a 2, a Constrictor Snake; on a 3, an Elephant; on a 4, a Mule.\n86-90 | A Hostile Swarm of Bats flies out of the hat, occupies your space, and attacks you.\n91-95 | A vertical, 10-foot-diameter, two-way portal to another plane of existence opens in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you and remains open until the end of your next turn. The DM determines where it leads.\n96-00 | You pull a magic item out of the hat. Roll 1d6 to determine the item's rarity: on a 1-3, Common; on a 4-5, Uncommon; on a 6, Rare. The DM chooses the item, which disappears after 1 hour if it's not consumed or destroyed before then.\n\nSource:\tDungeon Master's Guide 2024 p. 266",

If you play the pipes as a Magic action, you can take a Bonus Action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one Swarm of Rats with each expended charge if enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the DM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise.\n\nWhenever a Swarm of Rats that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, the swarm makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. On a failed save, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes Friendly to you and your allies for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as a Magic action. A Friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a Friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a Friendly swarm starts its turn more than 30 feet away from you, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.\n\nSource:\tDungeon Master's Guide 2024 p. 285",

While holding this weapon, you have Advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.\n\nAttack Deflection (Quarterstaff Form Only). When you are hit by an attack while holding the weapon, you can take a Reaction to twirl the weapon around you, gaining a +5 bonus to your Armor Class against the triggering attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you. You can't use this property again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.\n\nRanged Weapon (Quarterstaff Form Only). This weapon has Thrown with a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with the weapon, it flies back to your hand.\n\nTopple (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.\n\nThrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.\n\nVersatile: A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.\n\nProficiency: simple, quarterstaff\nSource:\tDungeon Master's Guide 2024 p. 291",

The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's energyânot the spell itselfâis stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. A canceled spell dissipates with no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod has no effect on that spell.\n\nWhen you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.\n\nIf you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of level 5. You use the stored levels in place of your slots but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a level 3 spell slot.\n\nA newly found rod typically has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.\n\nSource:\tDungeon Master's Guide 2024 p. 299",

You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.\n\nIf you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope.

You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location. Absent commands from you, the snake defends itself.\n\nAs a Bonus Action, you can command the snake to revert to staff form in its current space, and you can't use the staff's property again for 1 hour. If the snake is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it dies and reverts to its staff form; the staff then shatters and is destroyed.

The weapon deals an extra 1d8 Thunder damage to any creature it hits and an extra 3d8 Thunder damage to objects it hits that aren't being worn or carried.\n\nThe weapon has the following additional properties.\n\nClap of Thunder: As a Magic action, you can strike the weapon against a hard surface to create a loud clap of thunder audible out to 300 feet. You also create a 30-foot Cone of thunderous energy. Each creature in the Cone must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the Prone condition. Nonmagical objects in the Cone that aren't being worn or carried take 3d8 Thunder damage.\n\nEarthquake: As a Magic action, you can strike the weapon against the ground to create an intense seismic disturbance in a 50-foot-radius circle centered on the point of impact. Structures in contact with the ground in that area take 50 Bludgeoning damage, and each creature on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition. If that creature is also Concentrating, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or its Concentration is broken. In addition, you can cause a 30-foot-deep, 10-foot-wide fissure to open up on the ground anywhere in the area. Any creature on a spot where the fissure opens must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, falling into the fissure on a failed save or moving with the fissure's edge on a successful one. Any structure on a spot where the fissure opens collapses into the fissure. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nPush (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from yourself if it is Large or smaller.\n\nTwo-Handed: A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.\n\nProficiency: simple, greatclub\nSource:\tDungeon Master's Guide 2024 p. 316",

If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to notice.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose whether it's an explosive rune or a spell glyph, as explained below.\n\nSet the Trigger:\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\n\nYou can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\nExplosive Rune:\nWhen triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the glyph. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (your choice when you create the glyph) on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nSpell Glyph:\nYou can store a prepared spell of level 3 or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way.\n\nWhen the glyph is triggered, the stored spell takes effect.

You otherwise keep your game statistics.\n\nMeanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can't move and it is Incapacitated.\n\nWhile possessing a body, you can take a Magic action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature's soul to its body. If the host body dies while you're in it, the creature dies, and you make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.\n\nIf the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead, you die. If another creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.\n\nWhen the spell ends, the container is destroyed.",

If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice).\n\nWhen the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave a particular way. You can ask it to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.\n\nPayment can take a variety of forms. A Celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a Fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.\n\nA task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 GP per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 GP per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 GP per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\n\nAfter the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.",

Each one is explained below.\n\nSet the Trigger:\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph.\n\nYou can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\nOnce triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius Sphere with Dim Light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends.

You appear in the closest similar place. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might appear in another person's laboratory in the same city.\n\nOff Target:\nYou and your group (or the target object) appear 2d12 miles away from the destination in a random direction.

The creature's statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form after the spell ends and it returns to normal.",

            "description": "Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.\n\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don't need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\n\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n\nObject Creation:\nYou create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.\n\nInstant Health:\nYou allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the Greater Restoration spell.\n\nResistance:\nYou grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent.\n\nSpell Immunity:\nYou grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.\n\nSudden Learning:\nYou replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can't replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.\n\nRoll Redo:\nYou undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a Wish spell could undo an ally's failed saving throw or a foe's Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\n\nReshape Reality:\nYou may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god's divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails.\n\nThe stress of casting Wish to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 chance that you are unable to cast Wish ever again if you suffer this stress.",

Called by various names on different worlds -Moradin, Reorx, and others- that god gave dwarves an affinity for stone and metal and for living underground. The god also made them resilient like the mountains, with a life span of about 350 years.\n\nSquat and often bearded, the original dwarves carved cities and strongholds into mountainsides and under the earth. Their oldest legends tell of conflicts with the monsters of mountaintops and the Underdark, whether those monsters were towering giants or subterranean horrors. Inspired by those tales, dwarves of any culture often sing of valorous deeds-especially of the little overcoming the mighty.\n\nOn some worlds in the multiverse, the first settlements of dwarves were built in hills or mountains, and the families who trace their ancestry to those settlements call themselves hill dwarves or mountain dwarves, respectively. The Greyhawk and Dragonlance settings have such communities.\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 188",

When you create the device, you determine its function by choosing one effect from Prestidigitation; the device produces that effect whenever you or another creature takes a Bonus Action to activate it with a touch. If the chosen effect has options within it, you choose one of those options for the device when you create it. For example, if you choose the spell's ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether the device ignites or extinguishes fire; the device doesn't do both. You can have three such devices in existence at a time, and each falls apart 8 hours after its creation or when you dismantle it with a touch as a Utilize action."

That said, many halflings possess a brave and adventurous spirit that leads them on journeys of discovery, affording them the chance to explore a bigger world and make new friends along the way. Their size -similar to that of a human child- helps them pass through crowds unnoticed and slip through tight spaces.\n\nAnyone who has spent time around halflings, particularly halfling adventurers, has likely witnessed the storied \"luck of the halflings\" in action. When a halfling is in mortal danger, an unseen force seems to intervene on the halfling's behalf. Many halflings believe in the power of luck, and they attribute their unusual gift to one or more of their benevolent gods, including Yondalla, Brandobaris, and Charmalaine. The same gift might contribute to their robust life spans (about 150 years).\n\nHalfling communities come in all varieties. For every sequestered shire tucked away in an unspoiled part of the world, there's a crime syndicate like the Boromar Clan in the Eberron setting or a territorial mob of halflings like those in the Dark Sun setting.\n\nHalflings who prefer to live underground are sometimes called strongheart halflings or stouts. Nomadic halflings, as well as those who live among humans and other tall folk. are sometimes called lightfoot halflings or tallfellows.\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 193",

This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.\n\nUsing Bardic Inspiration. As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.\n\nOnce within the next hour when the creature fails a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it's rolled.\n\nNumber of Uses. You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\n\nAt Higher Levels. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5. a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 59",

                        "description": "You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Bard spells, which appear in the Bard spell list later in the class's description.\n\nCantrips:\nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. Dancing Lights and Vicious Mockery are recommended.\n\nWhenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your can trips with another can trip of your choice from the Bard spell list.\n\nWhen you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard Features table.\n\nSpell Slots:\nThe Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+:\nYou prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list. Charm Person, Color Spray, Dissonant Whispers, and Healing Word are recommended.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\n\nIf another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.\n\nChanging Your Prepared Spells:\nWhenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.\n\nSpellcasting Ability:\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.\n\nSpellcasting Focus:\nYou can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.\n\nLevel | Prepared Spells\n1 | 4\n2 | 5\n3 | 6\n4 | 7\n5 | 9\n6 | 10\n7 | 11\n8 | 12\n9 | 14\n10 | 15\n11 | 16\n12 | 16\n13 | 17\n14 | 17\n15 | 18\n16 | 18\n17 | 19\n18 | 20\n19 | 21\n20 | 22\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 59",

Guidance, Sacred Flame, and Thaumaturgy are recommended.\n\nWhenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list.\n\nWhen you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table.\n\nSpell Slots:\nThe Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+:\nYou prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list. Bless, Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt, and Shield of Faith are recommended.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels. 1 and 2 in any combination.\n\nIf another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.\n\nChanging Your Prepared Spells:\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.\n\nSpellcasting Ability:\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.\n\nSpellcasting Focus:\nYou can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.\n\nLevel | Prepared Spells\n1 | 4\n2 | 5\n3 | 6\n4 | 7\n5 | 9\n6 | 10\n7 | 11\n8 | 12\n9 | 14\n10 | 15\n11 | 16\n12 | 16\n13 | 17\n14 | 17\n15 | 18\n16 | 18\n17 | 19\n18 | 20\n19 | 21\n20 | 22\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 69",

Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).\n\nYou roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).\n\nTurn Undead:\nAs a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. Th is effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you die.\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 70",

Harnessing the magic of animals, plants, and the four elements, Druids heal, transform into animals, and wield elemental destruction.\n\nRevering nature above all, individual Druids gain their magic from nature, a nature deity, or both, and they typically unite with other Druids to perform rites that mark the passage of the seasons and other natural cycles.\n\nDruids are concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life and with the need for people to live in harmony with nature. Druids often guard sacred sites or watch over regions of unspoiled nature, but when a significant danger arises, Druids take a more active role as adventurers who combat the threat.\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 79",

                        "description": "You have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical forces of nature. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the Druid spell list later in the class's description.\n\nCantrips:\nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. Druidcraft and Produce Flame are recommended.\n\nWhenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another can trip of your choice from the Druid spell list.\n\nWhen you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table.\n\nSpell Slots:\nThe Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1â¢ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+:\nYou prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list. Animal Friendship, Cure Wounds, Faerie Fire, and Thunderwave are recommended.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\n\nIf another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.\n\nChanging Your Prepared Spells:\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots.\n\nSpellcasting Ability:\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.\n\nSpellcasting Focus:\nYou can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.\n\nLevel | Prepared Spells\n1 | 4\n2 | 5\n3 | 6\n4 | 7\n5 | 9\n6 | 10\n7 | 11\n8 | 12\n9 | 14\n10 | 15\n11 | 16\n12 | 16\n13 | 17\n14 | 17\n15 | 18\n16 | 18\n17 | 19\n18 | 20\n19 | 21\n20 | 22\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 79",

                        "description": "The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see \"Known Forms\" below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.\n\nNumber of Uses:\nYou can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\n\nYou gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.\n\nKnown Forms:\nYou know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see appendix B for stat block options). The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider, and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.\n\nWhen you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.\n\nWhen choosing known forms, you may look in the Monster Manual or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.\n\nDruid Level | Known Forms | Max CR | Fly Speed\n2 | 4 | 1/4 | No\n4 | 6 | 1/2 | No\n8 | 8 | 1 | Yes\n\nRules While Shape-Shifted:\nWhile in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:\n\nTemporary Hit Points:\nWhen you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level.\n\nGame Statistics:\nYour game statistics are replaced by the Beast's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast's stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.\n\nNo Spellcasting:\nYou can't cast spells, but shapeshifting doesn't break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you've already cast.\n\nObjects:\nYour ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature's size and shape. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you're in that form.\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 80",

You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+:\nYou prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start. choose two level 1 Paladin spells. Heroism and Searing Smite are recommended.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels. as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Paladin spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Paladin Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if youÂ·re a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.\n\nIf another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you.\n\nChanging Your Prepared Spells:\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots.\n\nSpellcasting Ability:\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.\n\nSpellcasting Focus:\nYou can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.\n\nLevel | Spells Prepared\n1 | 2\n2 | 3\n3 | 4\n4 | 5\n5 | 6\n7 | 7\n9 | 9\n11 | 10\n13 | 11\n15 | 12\n17 | 14\n19 | 15\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 109",

The information below details how you use those rules with Ranger spells. which appear in the Ranger spell list later in the class's description.\n\nSpell Slots:\nThe Ranger Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+:\nYou prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Ranger spells. Cure Wounds and Ensnaring Strike are recommended.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Ranger Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Ranger spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.\n\nIf another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for you.\n\nChanging Your Prepared Spells:\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell slots.\n\nSpellcasting Ability:\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells.\n\nSpellcasting Focus:\nYou can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.\n\nLevel | Spells Prepared\n1 | 2\n2 | 3\n2 | 4\n3 | 5\n4 | 6\n7 | 7\n9 | 9\n11 | 10\n13 | 11\n15 | 12\n17 | 14\n19 | 15\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 119",

Light, Prestidigitation, Shocking Grasp, and Sorcerous Burst are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.\n\nWhen you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table.\n\nSpell Slots:\nThe Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+:\nYou prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. Burning Hands and Detect Magic are recommended.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.\n\nIf another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.\n\nChanging Your Prepared Spells:\nWhenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.\n\nSpellcasting Ability:\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.\n\nSpellcasting Focus:\nYou can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.\n\nLevel | Prepared Spells\n1 | 2\n2 | 4\n3 | 6\n4 | 7\n5 | 9\n6 | 10\n7 | 11\n8 | 12\n9 | 14\n10 | 15\n11 | 16\n12 | 16\n13 | 17\n14 | 17\n15 | 18\n16 | 18\n17 | 19\n18 | 20\n19 | 21\n20 | 22\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 139",

The entity is a voice in the shadows-its identity unclear- but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the Warlock spell list later in the class's description.\n\nCantrips:\nYou know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.\n\nWhen you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.\n\nSpell Slots:\nThe Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1- 5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.\n\nFor example, when you're a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Witch Bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.\n\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+:\nYou prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. Charm Person and Hex are recommended.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1- 3.\n\nIf another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.\n\nChanging Your Prepared Spells:\nWhenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.\n\nSpellcasting Ability:\nCharisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.\n\nSpellcasting Focus:\nYou can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.\n\nLevel | Prepared Spells\n1 | 2\n2 | 3\n3 | 4\n4 | 5\n5 | 6\n6 | 7\n7 | 8\n8 | 9\n9 | 10\n11 | 11\n13 | 12\n15 | 13\n17 | 14\n19 | 15\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 153",

The information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the Wizard spell list later in the class's description.\n\nCantrips:\nYou know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. Light, Mage Hand, and Ray of Frost are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest. you can replace one of your can trips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.\n\nWhen you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cant rip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table.\n\nSpellbook:\nYour wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds. contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting Identify. You determine the book's appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.\n\nThe book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. Detect Magic, Feather Fall, Mage Armor, Magic Missile. Sleep, and Thunderwave are recommended.\n\nWhenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spell book. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.\n\nSpell Slots:\nThe Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level I+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+:\nYou prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.\n\nIf another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.\n\nChanging Your Prepared Spells:\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.\n\nSpellcasting Ability:\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.\n\nSpellcasting Focus:\nYou can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.\n\nLevel | Prepared Spells\n1 | 4\n2 | 5\n3 | 6\n4 | 7\n5 | 9\n6 | 10\n7 | 11\n8 | 12\n9 | 14\n10 | 15\n11 | 16\n12 | 16\n13 | 17\n14 | 18\n15 | 19\n16 | 21\n17 | 22\n18 | 23\n19 | 24\n20 | 25\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 165",

You could discover a Wizard spell on a Spell Scroll, for example, and then copy it into your spellbook.\n\nCopying a Spell into the Book:\nWhen you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it's of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.\n\nCopying the Book:\nYou can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell.\n\nIf you lose your spell book, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 166",
