For example, if you're a level 5 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.\n\nIf another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for you.\n\nChanging Your Prepared Spells:\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell slots.\n\nSpellcasting Ability:\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells.\n\nSpellcasting Focus:\nYou can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.\n\nLevel | Spells Prepared\n1 | 2\n2 | 3\n2 | 4\n3 | 5\n4 | 6\n7 | 7\n9 | 9\n11 | 10\n13 | 11\n15 | 12\n17 | 14\n19 | 15\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 119","type":"Ranger Class Feature","prerequisites":"","spellSlotsPerLevel":{"1":[2],"2":[2],"3":[3],"4":[3],"5":[4,2],"6":[4,2],"7":[4,3],"8":[4,3],"9":[4,3,2],"10":[4,3,2],"11":[4,3,3],"12":[4,3,3],"13":[4,3,3,1],"14":[4,3,3,1],"15":[4,3,3,2],"16":[4,3,3,2],"17":[4,3,3,3,1],"18":[4,3,3,3,1],"19":[4,3,3,3,2],"20":[4,3,3,3,2]},"preparedSpells":{"1":2,"2":4,"3":5,"4":6,"7":7,"9":9,"11":10,"13":11,"15":12,"17":14,"19":15},"cantrips":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0,"6":0,"7":0,"8":0,"9":0,"10":0,"11":0,"12":0,"13":0,"14":0,"15":0,"16":0,"17":0,"18":0,"19":0,"20":0}},{"id":"Level 1: Favored Enemy_Ranger","name":"Level 1: Favored Enemy","description":"You always have the Hunter's Mark spell prepared.
