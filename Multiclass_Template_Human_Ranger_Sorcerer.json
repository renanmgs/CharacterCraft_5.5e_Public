To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs.\n\nYou can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options.\n\nWhenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don't know.
